	bt graph - extend current graph
		reg_action, seq, deco
		graph.add_action("print", "Print", {msg = TYPE_STRING})
			no bt nodes in graph

	build BT
		save - graph-data, as BT data; 
			already have BT saver just need to translate graph to format
				dfs
		load - to graph, as BT
				
	sort out context menu

	Separate to ez-graph addon
		composite
			output types - not responsibility of node... is graph
				many to many
				one to many
			
			number of in/out - child class
				start
				min/max
				
			insert slot at idx
			renumber label idx/s on add
			separate idx input/output

	optional outputs (layers?)
		to tick
		utility
		
	strange nodes:
		viewport
		debug/inspect
	
REPORT:
	does not inform of multiple nodes selected, dragged
		get_selected() or drag select event
			or access to drag box
			
DONE:
	simplified node functions
		set slot
		root, composite, leaf
	auto-add outputs to composite
	get outputs from a node
	reorder children on disconnect
	y sort children on drag
