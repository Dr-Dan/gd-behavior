TODO:

	Invert not working correctly with AlwaysCondition
		storing incorrectly?

	build BT
		save
		load - to graph, as BT
		+ gui
		BT <-> Graph
				
	BTNode classes should inherit to/from_dict
		is causing many mistakes
		BTNodeGraphable?
		or get/set externally?

	start using asserts again

	delete selected
		disconnect parent and children
	
	copy/paste
		paste
			at mouse?
			last or next click pos

	test
		need to be able to connect easily via code
		dis/connect
		reorder
		save/load

	use window/panel instead of fancy options on nodes?
		selected info

		
	tool/editor panel
		
	context menu
		differentiate between node and empty space pressed
		node menu:
			delete, copy?, 
			change type - delete, store link data and replace/relink
		empty:
			paste
	
	Separate to ez-graph addon
		composite
			output types - not responsibility of node... is graph
				many to many
				one to many
			
			number of in/out - child class
				start
				min/max
				
			insert slot at idx
			renumber label idx/s on add
			separate idx input/output

	enhanced snap
		larger grid
		no overlap

	align selected: x, y

LATER:
	optional outputs (layers?)
		to tick
		utility
		
	strange nodes:
		viewport
		debug/inspect

	connect one2many
	connect mode
		drag from anywhere on body
	
REPORT/RESEARCH:
	does not inform of multiple nodes selected, dragged
		get_selected() or drag select event
			or access to drag box
	node deselected event
			
DONE:
	simplified node functions
		set slot
		root, composite, leaf
	auto-add outputs to composite
	get outputs from a node
	reorder children on disconnect
	y sort children on drag
